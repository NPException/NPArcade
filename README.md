# An arcade machine for minecraft.

People can write games in Java that can then be played on the machine.

Did you ever want to play custom games on an arcade cabinet in Minecraft, or even develop games for it yourself? Look no further!

The games are entirely client-side, so everyone can play the games they want, without impacting the game performance of other players.

If you want to play user-created games you need to follow these few steps:

1. Download a game for NPArcade from somewhere. If everything goes as planned, you should be able to find games in the NPArcade subreddit:Â https://www.reddit.com/r/nparcade/
2. Put the game's .jar or .zip file somewhere into the mods folder of your Minecraft instance. (I suggest putting games into the folder "/mods/nparcade_games" which will be created when you first launch Minecraft with the NP Arcade mod installed.
3. Launch the game! If the game is a valid NP Arcade game, its cartridge will show up in the creative mode tab of the mod.

Currently, game cartridges can only be acquired via command or in Creative Mode. Also, there are no official games shipped with the mod at the moment, since the mod is still in development.


## How to play

After you've grabbed a game cartridge from the NP Arcade creative mode tab, put it into the arcade cabinet by right-clicking. You can interact with the arcade cabinet by right-clicking it with an empty hand. All of your keyboard inputs will be used by the arcade machine from this point on.

To leave the cabinet, you need to double-tap the Escape key on your keyboard!


## State of development

The mod has now reached a state that I consider releasable for MC 1.7.10. No further development for the 1.7.10 version will take place, aside from some bug fixes and API changes based on game developer feedback.

Next step is porting the current state of the mod to MC 1.12.2. After that, I'll continue developing features of the mod.
